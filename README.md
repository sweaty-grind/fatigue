# fatigue

drank my first monster.  almost done...

guys.. i could just live better without this shit baggage you bring...  no???

i dont know man.  this silence from you is spooky.  but a ghosts exists on my repos lol.....

you know when i first started this thing with you i was really minding the monees aspect of all this lol..  today i have doubt about payment where it mattered lol...  oh welll  the lord said derp werp.

i dont know anymore honestly.  let me find something...

eating my words..  when does that occur lol...  dummy lol...

i figured something though.  these monsters are not obligatory...  they just cost monees.  what do you think about that concept???

so we were in  a small bubble that kept things correct.  no i dont know what is going on.  so dumb lol...

i can't see my way outta this can i???  you wanted game you got choking and cellular death...  i dont agree with these things you take from me.  feels like i have business with half par peoples...

so yeah. i need to be impressed not forced this mortal question on me.  i'm here on the next plane and you guys don't know what to do here...

i dont know bro.  i can't possibly be obsessed with the problems of our time by calling it just that...  you know i could be happier somewhere else...  just came here for princess wales island.  

i must remind you.  i don't believe in what we do.  i dont trust this shark you must be able to process more than me so its in your realm lol...  just imagine it bro.  i know its gonna hit hard.  my intentions are worth as much as the problem at hand...

i dont know what you want here. i didn't do ethnic master race shit with you.  things i would not want.  why are my wavelengths used this way???  i know my head is a little broken and you need it broken or something i wonder where the help has been for the last 5 years...
