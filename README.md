# fatigue

drank my first monster.  almost done...

guys.. i could just live better without this shit baggage you bring...  no???

i dont know man.  this silence from you is spooky.  but a ghosts exists on my repos lol.....

you know when i first started this thing with you i was really minding the monees aspect of all this lol..  today i have doubt about payment where it mattered lol...  oh welll  the lord said derp werp.

i dont know anymore honestly.  let me find something...

eating my words..  when does that occur lol...  dummy lol...

i figured something though.  these monsters are not obligatory...  they just cost monees.  what do you think about that concept???

so we were in  a small bubble that kept things correct.  no i dont know what is going on.  so dumb lol...

i can't see my way outta this can i???  you wanted game you got choking and cellular death...  i dont agree with these things you take from me.  feels like i have business with half par peoples...

so yeah. i need to be impressed not forced this mortal question on me.  i'm here on the next plane and you guys don't know what to do here...

i dont know bro.  i can't possibly be obsessed with the problems of our time by calling it just that...  you know i could be happier somewhere else...  just came here for princess wales island.  

i must remind you.  i don't believe in what we do.  i dont trust this shark you must be able to process more than me so its in your realm lol...  just imagine it bro.  i know its gonna hit hard.  my intentions are worth as much as the problem at hand...

i dont know what you want here. i didn't do ethnic master race shit with you.  things i would not want.  why are my wavelengths used this way???  i know my head is a little broken and you need it broken or something i wonder where the help has been for the last 5 years...

when i think of what i did with you guys, i cheesed the good feelings from it.  its not supposed to be taxed upon but it is...  i don't believe in this learning shit we have going on here...

so slow so slow.  magical creatures and not dwarf...

so like i wonder why you do this shit and all i can see is a dirty attempt at paradise.  never learn lol..  that's probably why you dont have monees you guys.  this intelligence work is a little lame...

so you know...  the service keeps you content.  people have your back...  i dont know where i belong in here dude.  that's the other thing. i don't know who you are lol...  i spent more time analyzing myself.  i think the ptsd is gone.  if you thought something else was gonna happen i would like to hear it.  lol...  i mean, where and what do you think i do with my life.  sharkey here stole all of it... i got complacent and i dropped so many people for no reason... right...

so you think i feel butt hurt about shit???

all of this time...  was worth something to you about 2 decades worth of shit...  we have actually been here for a while he says...  i assumed, it said so.  that's how it works...

so sigh my friend, when i summed up all numbers i went about another gigantic party.
