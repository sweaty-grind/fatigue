# fatigue

guys we been running too long.  and you appreciate my work here.  and that's how it works.  i wonder sometimes, that you would betray me like you have been for a while now.  how you just leave the map man with his map???  so i was like, literally, that stupid ass knows whats up.  too easy and lonely that after some time pounding mud would produce.

so i ask, why are we still doing this...  and i respond to myself with some idioit diatribe.  then i see no way forward.  even though its like a pattern i just though maybe like my life was so stupid i wondered anyone ever put anything on the table.  i already said i'll help out and shit, but i don't think i can offer you that either.  so take it???  i guess then you complain...  oh well...
