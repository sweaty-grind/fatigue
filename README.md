# fatigue

i am out of energon...  people think i do this that i enjoy it. i do enjoy it.  cause you have to...  cause you have to...

so things became what they were.  time was lost.  i dont' understand what is going on.  did you make me do this for a decade.  i thought money was soon...  one thing i know though, you guys are pussies.  

so you signed me up for a decades worth of work like this? i must be crazy.  honestly, you just fade away in my life like you came lol...  things were undone..  and it fixed a lot of problems.  and then he exclaims master race.  and your country is like that.  and then i get tired.  i did this for an idiot for 5 years now.  i must be crazy...

you know, you guys make excuses for not paying me but i'm quite frankly very tired.  from your crap.  the shark's crap.  people's crap.  perhaps one of these domains pays off like when i get my own crap.  i'm sorely disappointed in you guys though.  you ran weasal games and such.  not to trigger me.  but it did anyways.  and it was all fake and done to reach a certain objective.  and objective left unfortanately...  so i dont have much to do these days but fix myself.  trying to get out of this tangle of a mess with my brain...  you guys are sorely disappointing me.

no offense but you owe me my wavelengths back.. i never gave you permission to take them...  and then 90% of the jargon is like this but this guy doesn't want to admit it...  like he has a broken system...

seriously though dude, you think i'm butthurt i lost 5 years?? if this was done for any other cause i'd have to kill you...  why you play so dangerous i dont know, but this faith in the shark is something i am assuming pays off?? lol...  this looks like a disaster dude.
