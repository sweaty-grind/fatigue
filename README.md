# fatigue

i am out of energon...  people think i do this that i enjoy it. i do enjoy it.  cause you have to...  cause you have to...

so things became what they were.  time was lost.  i dont' understand what is going on.  did you make me do this for a decade.  i thought money was soon...  one thing i know though, you guys are pussies.  

so you signed me up for a decades worth of work like this? i must be crazy.  honestly, you just fade away in my life like you came lol...  things were undone..  and it fixed a lot of problems.  and then he exclaims master race.  and your country is like that.  and then i get tired.  i did this for an idiot for 5 years now.  i must be crazy...
